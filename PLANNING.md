# Project Planning: ssh-discord-bot

## 1. Project Goals

- Provide a Discord bot interface to manage remote servers via SSH.
- Allow users to execute commands, manage Docker containers/images, transfer files, etc.

## 2. Architecture

- **Language:** Node.js / JavaScript
- **Core Library:** [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) (or similar Node.js Discord library)
- **SSH Connection:** `ssh2` (or similar Node.js SSH library)
- **Configuration:** `.env` file for sensitive data (tokens, hostnames, credentials).
- **Modularity:** Commands likely organized into separate files/folders (e.g., the `commands` directory).

## 3. Code Style & Conventions

- **Style Guide:** (e.g., Airbnb, StandardJS - *confirm preferred style*)
- **Naming:** `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes/constructors.
- **Imports:** Use `require` or ES6 `import` statements.
- **File Size:** Keep files manageable; refactor large files.
- **Error Handling:** Use Promises/async-await with try-catch blocks, provide informative error messages.

## 4. Constraints

- **Discord API Limits:** Be mindful of rate limits and message length limits.
- **Security:** Securely handle SSH credentials and prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Resource Usage:** Optimize SSH connections and command execution to minimize server load.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual functions and command logic (e.g., using Jest, Mocha).
- Integration tests for SSH connection and command execution (potentially mocked).
- Tests ideally located in a `/tests` directory mirroring the app structure.
